The government of Elbonia uses several kinds of overhead surveillance vehicles. Every vehicle has a unique identification string. Each type of vehicle has a disctinct description. Most types of vehicles can hover, but some can not.

Declare and implement the classes named in the sample program below in such a way that the program compiles, executes, and produces exactly the output shown. You must not change the implementations of display or main.

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

Your declarations and implementations would go here

void display(const Vehicle* v)
{
    cout << v->id() << " is " << v->description();
    if (v->canHover())
        cout << ", so it can hover";
    cout << endl;
}

int main()
{
    Vehicle* fleet[4];
    fleet[0] = new Drone("CB4UP");
      // Balloons have an id and a diameter in meters  Balloons with a
      // diameter under 8 meters are small balloons; those with a diameter
      // 8 meters or more are large balloons
    fleet[1] = new Balloon("99LB", 6.3);
    fleet[2] = new Balloon("CN20230201", 30.2);
    fleet[3] = new Satellite("EB8675309");

    for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++)
        display(fleet[k]);

      // Clean up the vehicles before exiting
    cout << "Cleaning up" << endl;
    for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++)
        delete fleet[k];
}
Output produced:

CB4UP is a drone, so it can hover
99LB is a small balloon, so it can hover
CN20230201 is a large balloon, so it can hover
EB8675309 is a satellite
Cleaning up
Destroying CB4UP, a drone
Destroying the balloon 99LB
Destroying the balloon CN20230201
Destroying the satellite EB8675309
Decide which function(s) should be pure virtual, which should be non-pure virtual, and which could be non-virtual. Experiment to see what output is produced if you mistakenly make a function non-virtual when it should be virtual instead.

To force you to explore the issues we want you to, we'll put some constraints on your solution:

You must not declare any struct or class other than Vehicle, Drone, Balloon, and Satellite.
The Vehicle class must not have a default constructor. The only constructor you may declare for Vehicle must have exactly one parameter. The parameter must be of type string, and must be a useful parameter.
Although the expression new Drone("CB4UP") is fine, the expression new Vehicle("56-6693") must produce a compilation error. (A client can create a particular kind of vehicle, like a Drone, but is not allowed to create an object that is just a plain Vehicle.)
Other than constructors and destructors (which can't be const), all member functions must be const member functions.
No two functions with non-empty bodies may have the same implementation, or implementations that have the same effect for a caller. For example, there's a better way to deal with the id() function than to have each kind of vehicle declare and identically implement an id function. (For people looking for loopholes, notice that { return "drone"; } and { return "satellite"; } do not have the same effect, but { return "drone"; } and { string s("dr"); return s + "one"; } have the same effect, which is to return "drone". Similarly, for a function returning a bool, { return false; } and { return 42-42; } have the same effect since in the second case, the int 0 that is computed will be converted to the bool false to be returned.)
No implementation of an id() function may explicitly call any other function.
No class may have a data member whose value is identical for every object of a particular class type.
All data members must be declared private. You may declare member functions public or private. Your solution must not declare any protected members (which we're not covering in this class). Your solution must not contain the word friend.
In a real program, you'd probably have separate Vehicle.h, Vehicle.cpp, Drone.h, Drone.cpp, etc., files. For simplicity for this problem, you'll just put everything in one file. What you'll turn in for this problem will be a file named vehicle.cpp containing the definitions and implementations of the four classes, and nothing more. (In other words, turn in only the program text that replaces Your declarations and implementations would go here.)

The following is a declaration of a function that takes a double and returns true if a particular property of that double is true, and false otherwise. (Such a function is called a predicate.)

	bool somePredicate(double x);
Here is an example of an implementation of the predicate x is negative:

	bool somePredicate(double x)
	{
	    return x < 0;
	}
Here is an example of an implementation of the predicate sin ex is greater than cos x:

	bool somePredicate(double x)
	{
	    return sin(exp(x)) > cos(x); // include <cmath> for std::sin, etc.
	}
Here are five functions, with descriptions of what they are supposed to do. They are incorrectly implemented. The first four take an array of doubles and the number of doubles that should be considered to be in the array; the last takes two arrays of doubles and the number of doubles to examine in each. (Note: "position", "index", and "subscript" are synonymous when talking about an array: The beginning element is at position/index/subscript 0, etc.)

	  // Return true if the somePredicate function returns true for at
	  // least one of the array elements; return false otherwise.
	bool anyTrue(const double a[], int n)
	{
	    return false;  // This is not always correct.
	}

	  // Return the number of elements in the array for which the
	  // somePredicate function returns true.
	int countTrue(const double a[], int n)
	{
	    return -999;  // This is incorrect.
	}

	  // Return the subscript of the first element in the array for which
	  // the somePredicate function returns true.  If there is no such
	  // element, return -1.
	int firstTrue(const double a[], int n)
	{
	    return -999;  // This is incorrect.
	}

	  // Return the subscript of the smallest element in the array (i.e.,
	  // return the smallest subscript m such that a[m] <= a[k] for all
	  // k from 0 to n-1).  If the function is told that no doubles are to
	  // be considered in the array, return -1.
	int indexOfMinimum(const double a[], int n)
	{
	    return -999;  // This is incorrect.
	}

	  // If all n1 elements of a1 appear in the n2 element array a2, in
	  // the same order (though not necessarily consecutively), then
	  // return true; otherwise (i.e., if the array a1 is not a
	  // not-necessarily-contiguous subsequence of a2), return false.
	  // (Of course, if a1 is empty (i.e., n1 is 0), return true.)
	  // For example, if a2 is the 7 element array
	  //    10 50 40 20 50 40 30
	  // then the function should return true if a1 is
	  //    50 20 30
	  // or
	  //    50 40 40
	  // and it should return false if a1 is
	  //    50 30 20
	  // or
	  //    10 20 20
	bool isIn(const double a1[], int n1, const double a2[], int n2)
	{
	    return false;  // This is not always correct.
	}
Your implementations of those first three functions must call the function named somePredicate where appropriate instead of hardcoding a particular expression like x < 0 or sin(exp(x)) > cos(x). (When you test your code, we don't care what predicate you have the function named somePredicate implement: x < 0 or x == 42 or sqrt(log(x*x+1)) > 5 or whatever, is fine.)

Replace the incorrect implementations of these functions with correct ones that use recursion in a useful way; your solution must not use the keywords while, for, or goto. You must not use global variables whose values may change during execution or variables declared with the keyword static, and you must not modify the function parameter lists. You must not use any references or pointers as parameters except for the parameters representing arrays. (Remember that a function parameter x declared T x[] for any type T means exactly the same thing as if it had been declared T* x.) If any of the parameters n, n1, or n2 is negative, act as if it were zero.

Here is an example of an implementation of anyTrue that does not satisfy these requirements because it doesn't use recursion and it uses the keyword for:

	bool anyTrue(const double a[], int n)
	{
	    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++)
	    {
	        if (somePredicate(a[k]))
	            return true;
	    }
	    return false;
	}
You will not receive full credit if the anyTrue, countTrue, or firstTrue functions causes each value that somePredicate returns to be tested more than once. Consider all operations comparing two doubles (e.g. <=, ==, etc.) that a function performs. You will not receive full credit if for nonnegative n or n2, the indexOfMinimum function causes operations like these to be performed more than n times, or the isIn function causes them to be performed more than n2 times. For example, this non-recursive (and thus unacceptable for this problem) implementation of indexOfMinimum can perform a <= comparison of two doubles many, many more than n times, which is also unacceptable:

	int indexOfMinimum(const double a[], int n)
	{
	    for (int k1 = 0; k1 < n; k1++)
	    {
	        int k2;
	        for (k2 = 0; k2 < n && a[k1] <= a[k2]; k2++)
	            ;
	        if (k2 == n)
	            return k1;
	    }
	    return -1;
	}
Notice that this limit applies only to comparisons between two doubles; there's no limit on the number of integer comparisons.

Each of these functions can be implemented in a way that meets the spec without calling any of the other four functions. (If you implement a function so that it does call one of the other functions, then it will probably not meet the limit on comparisons of doubles.)

For this part of the homework, you will turn in one file named linear.cpp that contains the five functions and nothing more: no #include directives, no using namespace std;, no implementation of somePredicate and no main routine. (Our test framework will precede the functions with appropriate #include directives, using statement, and our own implementation of a function named somePredicate that takes a double and returns a bool.)

Replace the implementation of pathExists from Homework 2 with one that does not use an auxiliary data structure like a stack or queue, but instead uses recursion in a useful way. Here is pseudocode for a solution:

	If the start location is equal to the ending location, then we've
	    solved the maze, so return true.
	Mark the start location as visted.
	For each of the four directions,
	    If the location one step in that direction (from the start
	        location) is unvisited,
	            then call pathExists starting from that location (and
	                        ending at the same ending location as in the
	                        current call).
	                 If that returned true,
	                     then return true.
	Return false.
(If you wish, you can implement the pseudocode for loop with a series of four if statements instead of a loop.)

You may make the same simplifying assumptions that we allowed you to make for Homework 2 (e.g., that the maze contains only Xs and dots, the edges are all walls, etc.).

For this part of the homework, you will turn in one file named maze.cpp that contains the Coord class (only if you use it) and the pathExists function and nothing more.

Replace the incorrect implementations of the countIsIn and the order functions below with correct ones that use recursion in a useful way. Except in the code for the divide function that we give you below, your solution must not use the keywords while, for, or goto. You must not use global variables whose values may change during execution or variables declared with the keyword static, and you must not modify the function parameter lists. You must not use any references or pointers as parameters except for the parameters representing arrays and the parameters of the exchange and divide functions that we have provided. If any of the parameters n1, n2, or n is negative, act as if it were zero.

	  // Return the number of ways that all n1 elements of a1 appear in
	  // the n2 element array a2 in the same order (though not necessarily
	  // consecutively).  We decree that the empty sequence (i.e. one where
	  // n1 is 0) appears in a sequence of length n2 in 1 way, even if n2
	  // is 0.  For example, if a2 is the 7 element array
	  //	10 50 40 20 50 40 30
	  // then for this value of a1     the function must return
	  //	10 20 40                        1
	  //	10 40 30                        2
	  //	20 10 40                        0
	  //	50 40 30                        3
	int countIsIn(const double a1[], int n1, const double a2[], int n2)
	{
	    return -999;  // This is incorrect.
	}

	  // Exchange two doubles
	void exchange(double& x, double& y)
	{
	    double t = x;
	    x = y;
	    y = t;
	}

	  // Rearrange the elements of the array so that all the elements
	  // whose value is > divider come before all the other elements,
	  // and all the elements whose value is < divider come after all
	  // the other elements.  Upon return, firstNotGreater is set to the
	  // index of the first element in the rearranged array that is
	  // <= divider, or n if there is no such element, and firstLess is
	  // set to the index of the first element that is < divider, or n
	  // if there is no such element.
	  // In other words, upon return from the function, the array is a
	  // permutation of its original value such that
	  //   * for 0 <= i < firstNotGreater, a[i] > divider
	  //   * for firstNotGreater <= i < firstLess, a[i] == divider
	  //   * for firstLess <= i < n, a[i] < divider
	  // All the elements > divider end up in no particular order.
	  // All the elements < divider end up in no particular order.
	void divide(double a[], int n, double divider,
                                           int& firstNotGreater, int& firstLess)
	{
	    if (n < 0)
	    n = 0;
	
	      // It will always be the case that just before evaluating the loop
	      // condition:
	      //  firstNotGreater <= firstUnknown and firstUnknown <= firstLess
	      //  Every element earlier than position firstNotGreater is > divider
	      //  Every element from position firstNotGreater to firstUnknown-1 is
	      //    == divider
	      //  Every element from firstUnknown to firstLess-1 is not known yet
	      //  Every element at position firstLess or later is < divider
	
	    firstNotGreater = 0;
	    firstLess = n;
	    int firstUnknown = 0;
	    while (firstUnknown < firstLess)
	    {
	        if (a[firstUnknown] < divider)
	        {
	            firstLess--;
	            exchange(a[firstUnknown], a[firstLess]);
	        }
	        else
	        {
	            if (a[firstUnknown] > divider)
	            {
	                exchange(a[firstNotGreater], a[firstUnknown]);
	                firstNotGreater++;
	            }
	            firstUnknown++;
	        }
	    }
	}

	  // Rearrange the elements of the array so that
	  // a[0] >= a[1] >= a[2] >= ... >= a[n-2] >= a[n-1]
	  // If n <= 1, do nothing.
	void order(double a[], int n)
	{
	    return;  // This is not always correct.
	}
(Hint: Using the divide function, the order function can be written in fewer than eight short lines of code.)

Consider all operations comparing two doubles (e.g. <=, ==, etc.) that a function performs. You will not receive full credit if for nonnegative n1 and n2 and n2+1-n1 >= 0, the countIsIn function causes operations like these to be called more than factorial(n2+1) / (factorial(n1)*factorial(n2+1-n1)) times. (Notice that this limit applies only to comparisons between two doubles; there's no limit on the number of integer comparisons.) The countIsIn function can be implemented in a way that meets the spec without calling any of the functions in problem 2. (If you implement it so that it does call one of those functions, then it will probably not meet the limit stated in this paragraph.)

For this part of the homework, you will turn in one file named tree.cpp that contains the four functions above and nothing more.

Turn it in
By Tuesday, February 14, there will be a link on the class webpage that will enable you to turn in this homework. Turn in one zip file that contains your solutions to the homework problems. The zip file must contain one to four of the four files vehicle.cpp, linear.cpp, maze.cpp, and tree.cpp, depending on how many of the problems you solved. Your code must be such that if we insert it into a suitable test framework with a main routine and appropriate #include directives and using statements, it compiles. (In other words, it must have no missing semicolons, unbalanced parentheses, undeclared variables, etc.)
